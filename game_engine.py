class GameEngine:
    """Central orchestration layer / Application Service (Rule 8).

    request_move(...) is the single facade method for attempting a move,
    and executes checks in the required sequential order:
      1. Is the game already over?
      2. Is there already an active motion involving this piece, or a
         motion of the OPPOSING color anywhere on the board? (same-color
         pieces may still move in parallel - that's the core kung-fu-
         chess mechanic; the opposing color must wait for the in-flight
         motion to resolve first.)
      3. Does the RuleEngine validate and approve the move?
      4. If approved: initialize a Motion via the RealTimeArbiter.

    advance_time(...) drives virtual time forward, resolves arrivals
    atomically (Rule 10), resolves promotion (via PromotionRule) and
    triggers game_over on a King capture (Rule 11).

    Works purely in grid (row, col) terms - it knows nothing about
    pixels; that translation belongs to BoardMapper. It also knows
    nothing about click-selection UI state; that belongs to
    GameController (Rule 5: decouple validation/orchestration from the
    "who clicked vs where they want to go" concern).
